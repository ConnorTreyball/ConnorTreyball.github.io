Hello, everyone!

I'd like to use this first page of my website to explore some of the features of RStudio


To start, this is an example of a plot we've made in class:
```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- 21:30
plot(x,y)
```

Another example would be bolding text like so: **BOLD**

or

Italicizing text: *Italicizing*

or

Creating headers that have multiple layers: 

#LikeThis

##OrLikeThis

###OrLikeThis

> "You can use block quotes like this too"

RStudio even allows for the insertion of pictures:
<figure align = "middle">
<img src= "Knuckles_the_Echidna.jpg" style = "width:300px;">
