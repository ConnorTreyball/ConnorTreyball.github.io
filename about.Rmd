##**My life!**

My name is Connor Treyball and I'm a student at Appalachian State University. I've been studying psychology for the past few years and I have intentions of getting a Master's Degree in I-O psychology. I was originally born in Yorktown Heights, New York in 1996. I have 4 brothers and 1 sister that all live in different places. In the year 2008, part of my family relocated to Greensboro, North Carolina. We moved at a difficult time and I was still in middle school. Making friends and people in general became a huge interest of mine because. I'm very interested in how and why people do things. With that being said, one of the things that I am most passionate about is psychology. I have multiple family members who are intrigued by or have majored in psychology so it's always been a discussion in my house. My particular areas of interest within psychology are in personality, industrial-organizational, abnormal, and social psychology. Outside of school, I love to exercise and be physically active in general. I'd say my true passion is weight lifting. I go outside or to the gym at least once a day to be active. Something that's unique about myself is the amount of structure and order that goes into my routine. Being conscientious is a blessing and a curse but it's something that plays a big part in my life. I have specific times that I do certain things including: going to bed, waking up, studying, etc. I'm very passionate about my interests. Everything that I do, I put my heart into, and I have very high expectations. I enjoy living life and laughing more than anything. I'm very thankful for everything that I have.
